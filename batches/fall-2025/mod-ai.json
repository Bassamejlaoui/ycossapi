  "long_description": "We're building the first AI email client for accounting.\r\n\r\nWe're starting with accounts payable, because we learned that AP teams spend 80% of their day just in the inbox— that's 4x more time than actually processing invoices.\r\n\r\nOur platform equips you with agents that handle everything: triaging emails, managing multiple mailboxes, responding to vendor and internal inquiries, processing and matching invoices, onboarding vendors, and detecting fraud.\r\n\r\nFind out why customers choose Mod AI to manage their AP at usemod.ai. Backed by the first investors in Airbnb, DoorDash, and Dropbox.",

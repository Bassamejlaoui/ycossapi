  "long_description": "Goldbridge is building the financial operating system for the largest asset class in the world – real estate. More than $1T in rent flows through landlord bank accounts annually, with roughly a quarter locked in idle reserves and security deposits – and billions more leaking from unnecessary property expenses. And with $2.5T in real estate loans about to mature in 2027/28, property owners are desperate to boost their income ASAP. \r\n\r\nGoldbridge solves this problem by creating the first AI-powered banking platform for real estate owners. We are backed by Y Combinator and other world-class investors, and our founding team includes a 2x YC founder, former White House advisor, and 100-unit real estate owner/operator with deep industry expertise. Come help us redefine the future of real estate.",

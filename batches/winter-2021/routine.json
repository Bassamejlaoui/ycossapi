  "long_description": "Routine is an all-in-one workspace that allows individuals and team to manage their work and life through a single app.\r\n\r\nRoutine centralizes work (tasks, meetings, tickets, clients etc.) from third-party services (Github, Salesforce, Hubspot, Slack, Dropbox etc.) into a graph-based unified workspace allowing seamless cross-referencing, 360-degree overview, data enrichment and visualization.\r\n\r\nBy integrating with existing tools, Routine connects and enriches fragmented information, allowing users to track projects, collaborate efficiently, and make better decisions without having to constantly switch between multiple apps.\r\n\r\nIts data-driven and local-first approach ensures the information remains accessible and performant even without cloud connectivity.",

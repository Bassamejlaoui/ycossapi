  "long_description": "Stilta is the AI-native software for patent practitioners, built on agentic workflows to amplify how IP work is done end-to-end. Instead of spending weeks manually researching and drafting patents, practitioners can reduce manual work by up to ~50% while enabling new revenue streams.\r\n\r\nInnovation is key to solving the world’s most important challenges, but the tools to protect innovation haven’t kept up. Patent teams are stuck doing high-stakes work with a process built around manual document review and disconnected point solutions. Existing tools are rigid and fail by not integrating AI with clear traceability (every output must be source-backed, referenced, and auditable). General LLM solutions generate text, but they don’t solve trust and integration in legal-grade workflows.\r\n\r\nWe’re four engineers from McKinsey/QuantumBlack who’ve spent the last few years building and deploying AI for large organizations. We’re building Stilta because the practitioners protecting the world’s most valuable ideas deserve tools that match the stakes. We’re already live with paying customers in both Europe and the US. ",

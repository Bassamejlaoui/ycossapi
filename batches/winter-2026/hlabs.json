  "long_description": "HLabs is making an industrial supply chain for building robots in the USA including electronics and actuators.\r\n\r\nRobotics is going to be one of the largest industries the world has ever seen. Teams have to buy what they can from overseas and then build everything else in house just to get something to move. HLabs is producing a plug and play set of robotic primitives to accelerate the early development and then working with larger scale production robots for bespoke designs.\r\n\r\nEarly customers span across household robotics, humanoids, robot arms, quadrupeds, and defense.\r\n\r\nHlabs is founded by Paul, a second time YC founder who also participated in the W21 batch with Mystic. He ran Mystic as CEO for 6 years.\r\n\r\n",
